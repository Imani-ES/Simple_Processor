Simple 8 bit Processor using Verilog in the Vivado environment
Processor version1: 
- Uses behavioral verilog well.
- Executes instructions based on Opcode
- I stopped because I realized I wasn't using any of the required components
Processor version2:
- What professor wants
- Goes through cycle with if statements
**Could not simulate processor as toplevel for some reason.
  Ill ask in class and pretty much spend all day tommorow in Vivado anyway
**Modules we dont need**
Register File
DataMemory
InstructionMemory
